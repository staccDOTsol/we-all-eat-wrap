# SPL Token Wrap Program

This branch is a deployable fork of Solana's Token Wrap program built on
[staccDOTsol's reserve/supply pricing PR](https://github.com/solana-program/token-wrap/pull/694).
Its program ID is reserved locally; it has not been deployed. The program
keypair is kept outside the repository at
`/Users/stacc/.config/solana/we-all-eat-wrap-program.json`.

The proposed two-token launch has a [DBC preflight](./dbc/README.md) and a
[five-market DAMM v2 launcher and fee route](./launch/README.md). Both use
templates until the DBC mints, hook program, authorities, pool configs, and
seed amounts are chosen. No token, DBC, wrapper, or DAMM pool has been launched
by this repository. The transfer hook is a separate program and is still a
design dependency; this fork only forwards its required accounts during
wrapping and unwrapping.
The selected [power-pair design](./docs/power-pair-design.md) uses a
Tracer-style transfer between long and short collateral vaults. The two DBCs
are intended to stay on their curves with high finite migration thresholds.
The [standalone power-transfer math prototype](./strategy/README.md) is
implemented. The reserve-moving hook, oracle keeper, and mechanism linking
vault value to the traded token prices are not implemented yet.

This program enables the creation of "wrapped" versions of existing SPL tokens, facilitating interoperability between
different token standards. If you are building an app with a mint/token and find yourself wishing you could take
advantage of some of the latest features of a specific token program, this might be for you!

## Features

* **Bidirectional Wrapping:** Convert tokens between SPL Token and SPL Token-2022 standards in either direction,
  including conversions between different SPL Token-2022 mints.
* **Extensible Mint Creation:** The `CreateMint` instruction is designed to be extensible through the `MintCustomizer`
  trait. By forking the program and implementing this trait, developers can add custom logic to:
    * Include any SPL Token-2022 extensions on the new wrapped mint.
    * Modify default properties like the `freeze_authority` and `decimals`.
* **Confidential Transfers by Default:** All wrapped tokens created under the Token-2022 standard automatically include
  the `ConfidentialTransferMint` extension, enabling the option for privacy-preserving transactions. This feature is
  immutable and requires no additional configuration.
* **Transfer Hook Compatibility:** Integrates with tokens that implement the SPL Transfer Hook interface,
  enabling custom logic on token transfers.
* **Multisignature Support:** Compatible with multisig signers for both wrapping and unwrapping operations.
* **Metadata Synchronization:** Syncs metadata from unwrapped tokens (both Metaplex and Token-2022 standards) to their
  wrapped counterparts.

## How It Works

It supports the following primary operations:

1. **`CreateMint`:** This operation initializes a new wrapped token mint and its associated backpointer account. Note,
   the caller must pre-fund this account with lamports. This is to avoid requiring writer+signer privileges on this
   instruction.

    * **Wrapped Mint:** An SPL Token or SPL Token-2022 mint account is created. The address of this mint is a
      PDA derived from the *unwrapped* token's mint address and the *wrapped* token program ID. This ensures a unique,
      deterministic relationship between the wrapped and unwrapped tokens. The wrapped mint's authority is also a PDA,
      controlled by the Token Wrap program.
    * **Backpointer:** An account (also a PDA, derived from the *wrapped* mint address) is created to store the
      address of the original *unwrapped* token mint. This allows anyone to easily determine the unwrapped token
      corresponding to a wrapped token, facilitating unwrapping.

2. **`Wrap`:**  This operation accepts deposits of unwrapped tokens and mints wrapped tokens.

    * Unwrapped tokens are transferred from the user's account to an escrow account. Any unwrapped token account whose
      owner is a PDA controlled by the Token Wrap program can be used.
    * Wrapped tokens are minted at the current escrow-reserve-to-wrapper-supply
      rate, after any base-token transfer fee.

3. **`Unwrap`:** This operation burns wrapped tokens and releases unwrapped token deposits.

    * Wrapped tokens are burned from the user's wrapped token account.
    * Unwrapped tokens are released at the current escrow-reserve-to-wrapper-supply
      rate.

4. **`CloseStuckEscrow`:** This operation handles an edge case with re-creating a mint with the MintCloseAuthority
   extension.

    * The escrow ATA can get "stuck" when an unwrapped mint with a close authority is closed and then a new mint is
      created at the same address but with different extensions, leaving the escrow ATA (Associated Token Account) in an
      incompatible state.
    * The instruction closes the old escrow ATA and returns the lamports to a specified destination account.
    * This operation will only succeed if the current escrow has zero balance and has different extensions than the
      mint.
    * After closing the stuck escrow, the client is responsible for recreating the ATA with the correct extensions.

5. **`SyncMetadataToToken2022`**: This operation copies metadata from an unwrapped mint to its wrapped Token-2022
   mint's `TokenMetadata` extension.
    * It initializes the `TokenMetadata` extension on the wrapped mint if it doesn't already exist.
    * The caller is responsible for pre-funding the wrapped mint account with enough lamports to cover the rent for the
      added space.
    * Supports: `SPL Token -> Token-2022` and `Token-2022 -> Token-2022`.

6. **`SyncMetadataToSplToken`**: This operation copies metadata from an unwrapped mint to the Metaplex metadata
   account of its wrapped SPL Token mint.
    * It can create the Metaplex metadata account if it doesn't exist or update an existing one.
    * The `wrapped_mint_authority` PDA acts as the payer for the Metaplex program CPI and must be pre-funded with
      sufficient lamports to cover rent for the Metaplex account.
    * Supports: `Token-2022 -> SPL Token` and `SPL Token -> SPL Token`.

The first wrap, when wrapper supply is zero, mints units 1:1 against the net
base amount received. Later wraps and unwraps use the escrowed base reserve
divided by outstanding wrapper supply, rounding down. A donation to the base
escrow increases the base-token amount redeemable per wrapper; it does not
deposit liquidity into a DAMM v2 pool. The wrapper remains backed by the
base tokens in its escrow, subject to the base mint's own authorities and
transfer behavior.

### Hooked Token-2022 base mints

The `wrap` and `unwrap` CLI subcommands accept repeated
`--hook-account PUBKEY[:writable]` arguments. Supply the hook program ID, its
`ExtraAccountMetaList` PDA for the base mint, and every additional account the
list requires, in hook order and with the required write flags. The CLI
forwards these accounts; it does not discover or resolve them from the list.
Missing or misordered accounts make the underlying Token-2022 transfer fail.
The program tests exercise this forwarding with a counter hook and an ordinary
SPL wrapper. The proposed reserve-moving strategy hook remains separate.

## Permissionless design

The SPL Token Wrap program is designed to be **permissionless**. This means:

* **Anyone can create a wrapped mint:**  No special permissions or whitelisting is required to create a wrapped
  version of an existing mint. The `CreateMint` instruction is open to all users, provided they can
  pay the required rent for the new accounts.
* **Anyone can wrap and unwrap tokens:**  Once a wrapped mint has been created, any user holding the underlying
  unwrapped tokens can use the `Wrap` and `Unwrap` instructions. All transfers are controlled by PDAs owned by the Token
  Wrap program itself. However, it is important to note that if the *unwrapped* token has a freeze authority,
  that freeze authority is *preserved* in the wrapped token.

## Confidential Transfer extension

The `ConfidentialTransferMint` extension is added to every Token-2022 wrapped mint and initialized with the following
config:

* **No Authority:** The confidential transfer authority is set to `None`, making the configuration immutable. This
  ensures that the privacy features cannot be disabled or altered after the wrapped mint is created.
* **No Auditor:** The wrapped mints are created without a confidential transfer auditor. This means that there is no
  third party that can view the details of confidential transactions.
* **Automatic Account Approval:** New token accounts are approved for confidential transfers by default. This allows
  users to make private transactions permissionlessly.

## Customizing mint

If the current wrapped mint config does not suit your needs, please fork! A few places you are going to want to update:

- Add a new struct that implements `MintCustomizer` in `program/src/mint_customizer`
- Replace the current one in use within the processor: `program/src/processor.rs`
- Re-run tests (see `package.json`) and update/remove assertions to accommodate new config
- If wanting to make use of clients:
    - CLI: Update mint customizer type in `clients/cli/src/create_mint.rs`
    - JS: Update mint size in `clients/js/src/create-mint.ts`
